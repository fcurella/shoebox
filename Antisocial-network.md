A social network with NONE of the addictive mechanics: no likes, comments, hashtags or trending topics. Additionally, people gets penalized for posting frequently: the more frequently they post, the less ranking their postings have.

Possibly no posts at all. Just hanging out as a virtual 3rd place (eg: HouseParty)
