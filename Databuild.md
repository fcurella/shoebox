I see a lot of dataviz projects that either do not include their data, or only include them in their initial or final form, without including any transformation they made to the data.

It would be nice if there was a tool / language to share the entire process the data went through, from the initial download up to the final shape fed to the visualization.

The idea is to create something like 'scripted excel', most likely a declarative API to pandas.
